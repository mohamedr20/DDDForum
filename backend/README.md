Went ahead and built a quick CRUD API following the guidelines for the code-first assignment.
The routes were tested manually and verified to pass all the flows shown on the spec.

Technology Used:
  - Docker for Postgres/PGAdmin Containers
  - Express + Typescript For API Layer
  - Prisma for Database ORM

I personally added:
  - Very naive validation for user inputs
  - Unsafe random password generation
  - Types for response & error types
